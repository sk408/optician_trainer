  title: 'Ophthalmic Lens Basics',
  introduction: 'Ophthalmic lenses are precision optical devices that correct vision by compensating for refractive errors. Think of them as custom-made tools that help redirect light into the eye properly. This module covers fundamental concepts about prescription lenses in simple language that will help you understand more advanced topics later on, and explain lens options clearly to your patients.',
  objectives: [
    'Identify different types of ophthalmic lenses and their uses',
    'Understand lens materials and their characteristics',
    'Recognize basic lens measurements and terminology',
    'Explain how different lens designs correct specific vision problems',
    'Understand lens treatments and coatings',
    'Learn how to interpret basic prescriptions'

  summary: 'Ophthalmic lenses correct vision through various designs: spherical lenses correct nearsightedness or farsightedness, cylindrical components address astigmatism, and multifocal designs help with presbyopia. Modern lens materials range from standard plastic (CR-39) to impact-resistant polycarbonate and lightweight high-index options, each with different characteristics affecting thickness, weight, and optical quality. Essential measurements like pupillary distance ensure proper lens positioning, while treatments such as anti-reflective coatings and UV protection enhance performance and eye health. Understanding these fundamentals allows beginning opticians to interpret prescriptions correctly and recommend appropriate lens solutions based on patients\' vision needs, lifestyle requirements, and preferences.',
