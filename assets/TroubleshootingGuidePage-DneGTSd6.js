        Proper glasses fit is essential for comfort and optimal vision. Here's how to diagnose and fix common fit problems:

        1. Glasses Sliding Down
        - Cause: Nose pads too wide or frame too heavy
        - Solution: Adjust nose pads inward or tighten temple arms
        - Additional Fix: Consider adding silicone nose grips for plastic frames
        - When to Refer: If weight is the primary issue, suggest a lighter frame material

        2. Pinching at the Nose
        - Cause: Nose pads too close together
        - Solution: Gently adjust nose pads outward
        - Check For: Redness or indentation marks on the nose bridge
        - Prevention: Select frames with adjustable nose pads for patients with narrow bridges

        3. Pressure Behind the Ears
        - Cause: Temple arms too tight or incorrect angle
        - Solution: Adjust temple arms outward slightly and ensure proper downward angle
        - Technique: Heat temple tips for easier adjustment with acetate frames
        - Evaluation: Ensure 45° angle at the bend for proper weight distribution

        4. Uneven Frame
        - Cause: Uneven adjustment or facial asymmetry
        - Solution: Adjust frame alignment using proper optical tools
        - Assessment: Look for level lens heights and even temple positioning
        - Advanced Technique: Use frame warmer for more precise adjustments
