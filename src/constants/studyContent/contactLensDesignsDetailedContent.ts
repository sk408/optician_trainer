  summary: 'This module presented detailed information on the design principles of various contact lens types. We explored the specific parameters and features of soft lenses, rigid gas permeable lenses, and specialty designs like scleral and orthokeratology lenses. The module also covered therapeutic lens designs for ocular surface management and emerging technologies like drug-delivering and biosensing lenses. Understanding these design principles is essential for selecting appropriate lenses for different patient needs and optimizing lens performance.',
