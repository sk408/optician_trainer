  summary: 'Occupational lenses and safety eyewear represent specialized categories of vision correction and protection that address the unique requirements of diverse workplace environments. By understanding occupational visual demands, appropriate lens designs, safety standards, and proper fitting techniques, opticians can provide customized solutions that enhance visual performance, comfort, and protection. The right occupational eyewear not only improves workplace productivity and reduces visual fatigue but also plays a critical role in preventing eye injuries and maintaining long-term eye health.',
