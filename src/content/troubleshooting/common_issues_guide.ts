      title: 'Troubleshooting Glasses Fit Issues',
      content: `
        Proper glasses fit is essential for comfort and optimal vision. Here's how to diagnose and fix common fit problems:

        1. Glasses Sliding Down
        - Cause: Nose pads too wide or frame too heavy
        - Solution: Adjust nose pads inward or tighten temple arms
        - Additional Fix: Consider adding silicone nose grips for plastic frames
        - When to Refer: If weight is the primary issue, suggest a lighter frame material

        2. Pinching at the Nose
        - Cause: Nose pads too close together
        - Solution: Gently adjust nose pads outward
        - Check For: Redness or indentation marks on the nose bridge
        - Prevention: Select frames with adjustable nose pads for patients with narrow bridges

        3. Pressure Behind the Ears
        - Cause: Temple arms too tight or incorrect angle
        - Solution: Adjust temple arms outward slightly and ensure proper downward angle
        - Technique: Heat temple tips for easier adjustment with acetate frames
        - Evaluation: Ensure 45Â° angle at the bend for proper weight distribution

        4. Uneven Frame
        - Cause: Uneven adjustment or facial asymmetry
        - Solution: Adjust frame alignment using proper optical tools
        - Assessment: Look for level lens heights and even temple positioning
        - Advanced Technique: Use frame warmer for more precise adjustments

      keyPoints: [
        'Most fit issues can be resolved with proper adjustment techniques',
        'Always verify adjustments by having the patient wear glasses for at least 5 minutes',
        'Document all adjustments made for future reference'

      title: 'Vision Problems With New Glasses',
      content: `
        When patients report vision issues with new glasses, follow this troubleshooting path:

        1. Blurry Vision
        - First Check: Verify prescription against lab order
        - Measurement Check: Confirm PD and OC heights are correct
        - Physical Inspection: Look for lens warpage or fabrication errors
        - Adaptation Period: Explain normal adaptation time (1-2 weeks for progressive lenses)

        2. Double Vision
        - Potential Causes: Incorrect PD, vertical imbalance, or prismatic effect
        - Check For: Lens centration and vertical alignment
        - Tests: Cover test to check for underlying binocular vision issues
        - Solution: Adjust lens position or remake with corrected measurements

        3. Distortion with Progressive Lenses
        - Common Issues: "Swimming" sensation, peripheral distortion
        - Frame Check: Ensure frame is properly adjusted and not sitting too low/high
        - Measurement Verification: Confirm fitting cross alignment with pupil
        - Adaptation Tips: Teach proper head positioning and suggest gradual wear increase

        4. Headaches or Eye Strain
        - First Action: Check for excessive lens tilt or wrap angle
        - Common Causes: Incorrect cylinder axis, PD errors, or excessive prismatic effect
        - Solution Path: Verify all measurements and make minor adjustments before considering remake
        - Documentation: Track time of day and specific activities that trigger symptoms

      keyPoints: [
        'Always verify prescription and measurements before assuming fabrication error',

      title: 'Contact Lens Troubleshooting',
      content: `
        Contact lens issues require systematic assessment:

        1. Discomfort or Awareness
        - Initial Check: Examine for debris, tears, or inside-out lenses
        - Fit Evaluation: Check for proper movement and centration
        - Solution Issues: Consider preservative sensitivity or solution incompatibility
        - Action Plan: Try different solution, evaluate fit parameters, or switch material

        2. Vision Fluctuation
        - Common Causes: Lens dehydration, deposits, or fit issues
        - Assessment: Evaluate tear film quality and lens wettability
        - Solution: Consider more frequent replacement schedule or different material
        - Education: Discuss proper blinking techniques and environmental factors

        3. Redness and Irritation
        - Immediate Action: Assess for potential corneal abrasion or infection
        - Check For: Tight lens syndrome, solution sensitivity, or overwear
        - Solution Path: Temporary discontinuation and lubricating drops
        - Referral Criteria: When to refer for medical evaluation immediately

        4. Handling Difficulties
        - Assessment: Evaluate dexterity and technique
        - Teaching Tools: Use colored training lenses for visualization
        - Alternative Options: Discuss daily disposables for convenience
        - Support Materials: Provide step-by-step printed guides with images
