  introduction: 'Selecting the right frame for a patient involves understanding various frame styles, their applications, and how to match them to different facial features, prescriptions, and lifestyle needs. This module covers the wide range of frame styles available, selection criteria based on facial characteristics, and recommendations for specific prescriptions and usage scenarios.',
  objectives: [
    'Identify major frame styles and their defining characteristics',
    'Understand how to match frame shapes to different face shapes',
    'Learn how to select frames based on prescription requirements',
    'Master the art of suggesting frames based on lifestyle and occupation',
