  summary: 'Comprehensive patient education and consistent follow-up care are fundamental to successful contact lens practice. Effective education encompasses proper insertion and removal techniques tailored to lens type, detailed care regimen instruction, compliance strategies, and recognition of warning signs requiring prompt attention. Follow-up protocols should be customized based on lens modality, wearing experience, and individual risk factors, with new wearers and specialty lens users requiring more frequent assessment. Non-compliance remains a significant challenge affecting 40-70% of lens wearers, but can be addressed through motivational interviewing, simplified regimens, and patient-centered approaches targeting specific barriers. Emergency response education is critical, with patients needing clear instructions on identifying red flags such as pain, redness, and vision changes. Documentation throughout the education and follow-up process serves both clinical and risk management purposes. By integrating these components into clinical practice, practitioners can significantly enhance wearing success, reduce complication rates, and improve long-term patient satisfaction with contact lens correction.',

        'A patient wearing monthly replacement silicone hydrogel lenses',
        'A daily disposable lens wearer with no history of complications'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'A new orthokeratology lens wearer requires the most frequent follow-up schedule, typically including visits at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and then annually. This intensive follow-up is necessary to verify proper corneal reshaping, adaptation, and to monitor for any adverse effects during the critical initial treatment period.'

        'Solution hypersensitivity',
        'Giant papillary conjunctivitis',
        'Acanthamoeba keratitis'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: 'The primary risk associated with using tap water to rinse a contact lens case is Acanthamoeba keratitis. Acanthamoeba is a waterborne organism found in tap water that can cause a severe, painful corneal infection that is difficult to treat and can lead to permanent vision loss. Cases should only be rinsed with fresh contact lens solution, never tap water.'

        'Explaining the increased risk of complications without making any changes to the prescription',
        'Switching the patient to a daily disposable lens modality',
        'Prescribing a quarterly replacement lens instead'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Switching to daily disposable lenses is most likely to improve compliance for a patient who consistently extends the wearing time of monthly lenses. Daily disposables eliminate the temptation to overwear lenses since they are discarded daily, simplify the care regimen, and reduce the risk of complications associated with solution use and case contamination.'
