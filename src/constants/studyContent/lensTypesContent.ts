  title: 'Types of Lenses',
  introduction: 'Understanding ophthalmic lenses is like learning the alphabet before reading - it\'s a fundamental skill every optician needs. Each lens type serves a specific purpose in correcting vision problems. This module will help you identify different lens types, understand how they work, and know when to use them. We\'ll use simple, everyday examples to make these concepts easy to grasp, even if you\'re new to optics.',
  objectives: [
    'Differentiate between convex (plus) and concave (minus) lenses using simple visual cues',
    'Explain the optical properties of spherical and cylindrical lenses in everyday terms',
    'Connect specific lens types to the vision problems they correct',
    'Master essential terminology used to describe different lens types',
    'Recognize how lens shape affects optical power and vision correction',

  summary: 'This module covered the fundamental types of ophthalmic lenses. Convex (plus) lenses are thicker in the center and converge light to correct hyperopia and presbyopia. Concave (minus) lenses are thinner in the center and diverge light to correct myopia. Spherical lenses have uniform power in all meridians, while cylindrical lenses have different powers in different meridians to correct astigmatism. Most prescription lenses are sphero-cylindrical combinations that address both spherical refractive errors and astigmatism simultaneously. Understanding these basic lens types allows you to interpret prescriptions correctly, recommend appropriate lenses for patients, and troubleshoot common vision problems and complaints.',

    {
      question: 'Which of the following lens types would be used to correct myopia (nearsightedness)?',
      options: [
        'Convex lens',
        'Concave lens',
        'Cylindrical lens only',
        'Prism lens'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Concave (minus) lenses are used to correct myopia because they diverge light rays. This helps focus light properly on the retina instead of in front of it, which occurs in myopic eyes.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can you visually identify a convex lens?',
      options: [
        'It is thinner in the center than at the edges',
        'It is thicker in the center than at the edges',
        'It has the same thickness throughout',
        'It is colored blue at the edges'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Convex (plus) lenses are thicker in the center than at the edges, giving them a bulging middle appearance, like a magnifying glass. This shape causes light rays to converge.'
    },
    {
      question: 'In a prescription written as "+2.50 -1.00 x 180", what does the "-1.00" represent?',
      options: [
        'The spherical power',
        'The cylindrical power',
        'The axis',
        'The add power'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'In a prescription, the middle number (in this case, -1.00) represents the cylindrical power, which corrects astigmatism. The cylindrical component always includes both a power and an axis (the "x 180" part).'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which lens type has uniform power in all meridians?',
      options: [
        'Cylindrical lens',
        'Sphero-cylindrical lens',
        'Spherical lens',
        'Prismatic lens'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Spherical lenses have uniform power in all meridians, meaning they have the same curvature in all directions, like a portion of a basketball. This is in contrast to cylindrical lenses, which have different powers in different meridians.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What does the axis measurement represent in a cylindrical lens prescription?',
      options: [
        'The thickness of the lens at its center',
        'The direction of maximum cylindrical power',
        'The meridian that has no cylindrical power',
        'The overall strength of the lens'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'The axis in a cylindrical lens prescription (measured in degrees from 1 to 180) indicates the meridian that has no cylindrical power. The maximum cylindrical power is located 90 degrees away from this axis.'
    },
    {
      question: 'When moving a minus lens side to side while looking through it at an object, the object appears to:',
      options: [
        'Move in the opposite direction of the lens',
        'Move in the same direction as the lens',
        'Stay stationary',
        'Blur out completely'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'When looking through a minus lens and moving it side to side, objects appear to move in the same direction as the lens. This is a quick way to identify a minus lens. Conversely, objects viewed through a plus lens appear to move in the opposite direction.'
    },
    {
      question: 'A prescription for "+3.00 DS" would require what type of lens?',
      options: [
        'Concave spherical lens',
        'Convex spherical lens',
        'Cylindrical lens',
        'Sphero-cylindrical lens'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'A prescription of "+3.00 DS" indicates a convex spherical lens with +3.00 diopters of power. The "DS" stands for "diopters sphere," indicating there is no cylindrical component.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which type of lens is used to correct astigmatism?',
      options: [
        'Spherical lens only',
        'Cylindrical lens',
        'Convex lens only',
        'Concave lens only'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Cylindrical lenses are used to correct astigmatism because they have different powers in different meridians, which compensates for the irregular corneal or lens shape that causes astigmatism.'
    },
    {
      question: 'The power of a lens measured in diopters is:',
      options: [
        'Directly proportional to the focal length',
        'The reciprocal of the focal length in meters',
        'Equal to the focal length in millimeters',
        'The square of the focal length'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'The power of a lens in diopters (D) is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters: Power (D) = 1 / Focal Length (m). This means a lens with a focal length of 0.5 meters has a power of +2.00 D (1 รท 0.5 = 2).'
    },
    {
      question: 'When dispensing glasses for a patient with a high minus prescription, which frame characteristic is most important to consider?',
      options: [
        'The frame should be as large as possible',
        'The frame should be relatively small',
        'The frame should be rimless',
        'The frame material doesn\'t matter'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'For high minus prescriptions, smaller frames are preferable because they reduce the overall lens diameter. This results in thinner edges, less weight, better cosmetics, and potentially better optics. Large frames with high minus prescriptions result in very thick, heavy lenses at the edges.'
